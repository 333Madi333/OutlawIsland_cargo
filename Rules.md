# Rules

*Outlaw Island* is a private server that is led by a group of volunteer directors. The management of this server is at the discretion of the directors and they reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason.

## General

```- Scum is early access - this means that bugs and glitches will happen. Unless there is a video showing what was lost and how it was lost, no items will be replaced. 
- The server is US based; keep all chat in English. This is necessary for us to monitor the server.
- Player names must have a minimum of 3 English letters and not include links.
- If asked to change your name by a Director, it must be done immediately.
- Discord names will be adjusted to match your in-game name if "illegible"
- Do not message the directors and staff directly, please raise a support ticket.
- Directors and staff will not get involved in inter-squad politics, unless it impacts the greater community.
- Directors and staff only play on this server with a non-admin alt account. 
- The Directors may not get the rules right. In the event of an unprecedented situation or a case not explicitly covered by existing rules, the directors reserve the right to evaluate and decide on the matter at its sole discretion. Such decisions will be made in alignment with the servers best interests.
```

## Conduct

In SCUM, we step into the role of desperate prisoners fighting for freedom in a brutal TV show, where survival might mean theft, betrayal, or worse. Remember, though, that in-game actions, chat messages, and Discord interactions are all part of the fiction—our characters’ choices don’t reflect our real intentions or personalities.

Let’s stay mindful and respectful, knowing that we all invest time and heart into this game, and that time is valuable.

```- Have fun.
- Don't be a jerk, avoid negativity, and absolutely no toxicity.  These are bannable offenses at the director's discretion.
- Insulting, racist, discriminatory, sexist, or disrespectful comments and language are not tolerated and considered a banable offence.
- If you have a complaint or grievance about the server or staff - open a ticket and have the discussion there. Arguing with staff in public (in-game or on discord) or in a direct message will result in your accounts being muted for 7 days or more.
- Acting as a Director or acting as if you have authority is prohibited
- When a player asks for a Director or admin in game, suggest they open a ticket.
- Intentionally killing a Director or staff member that is helping you for fame points, joking or not, will result in a fame point penalty, and/or ban.
- Do not stream-snipe. 
- At the discretion of the Directors, previous VAC bans or reports of hacking by owners of other collaborating servers may result in immediate ban without warning.
- If you have a question about the rules, file a ticket to discuss.
```

## Streaming

```- Streamers must take appropriate measures to protect themselves from stream sniping. For example using time delay, map hiding, etc.
- Public defamation about the server or staff is prohibited.  Please file a ticket to discuss your grievance prior to making any comments in your stream.
```

## Squad Size

```- INT 1, 2, & 3 =  6
- INT 4 & 5 = 8 
```

## Building

```- Maximum of two (2) flags per squad.
- 400 Base Building elements per flag
- +35 elements per squad member.
```

## Prohibited Areas

```Building is allowed anywhere, provided the game allows it.

```

## PvE Zones

These zones are identified in green on the in game map and excluded from raiding.  Any other area you should assume PvP unless specified otherwhere in the rules or by the admins

```- Harassing, raiding, and/or griefing PvE players in or around their base location is a banable offense.
- Damage to players is limited to brawling (fists) in PvE and being run over by a vehicle.  Yes, this means its not 100% safe, so keep your wits about you.
- Lockpicking player locks is disabled in PVE
- You are allowed to PvP outside of the PvE sectors but will not be able to help defend a friendly base from within. The only way a PVE player is allowed to be inside a PVP base is with online escort of a member of the owning squad. If PVP/raid starts while inside, PVE players may not help defend and should seek a way out or remain inactive within the base.
- If you have a base in PvE, you CANNOT have a base in PvP
- You CANNOT raid bases (in PvE and PvP), but you are allowed to 3rd party assist from outside the base. 
- Lethal traps/mines are not allowed in PvE. Non-lethal traps such as flare traps or firework traps are allowed anywhere.
- NO overtaking flags
- Lock and secure your stuff.  Admins will not be held responsible for stolen items that are not safely stored within your flag zone behind a locked door.   It is always your responsibility to secure your items.
- Don’t be a coward.  Evading PvP by crossing back and forth between PvE and PvP zones is severely frowned upon. Admins will take action by teleporting you to a random remote island.    
```

## Raiding

Raiding is defined as lockpicking, destruction, griefing, or entering another player or squads locked or unlocked base or an act of aggression towards a player within their base either online or offline. Please be respectful whilst raiding; rampant acts of griefing or deliberate vandalism is frowned upon.

```- Raiding hours are 24/7.
- Killing freshly spawned oranges is discouraged, but not prohibited, unless you are preventing them from parachuting directly into your base. 
- There is a limit of 2 raids per squad per 24 hours
- Combat logging is considered cowardice and will not halt a raid.
- Squads may make an amicable raiding agreement outside these rules, setting any raid terms they like.
- A raiding party opting to use an available flag to create a defensible position may place mines for the sole purpose of fortifying and protecting temporary structures, vehicles, and weapon caches.
```

## Mines

```- Mines may only be placed inside your flag zone.

```

## Vehicles

```Players/Squads that are found abusing vehicles in a way that harms the overall community will be contacted by a director at the director's discretion. Refusal to cooperate with the directors' decision will result in a 5 day temporary ban.

```

## Accusations / Cheating

Cheaters may be toyed with, hunted, and then banned without notice.

```- Any suspicious activity must be reported via a ticket. Do not make public accusations in either the game or discord. Do not DM a Director or admin directly.
- Utilizing exploits to prevent players from entering or exiting an area is not allowed.
- Hacks and dupes will get you banned immediately.
- Association with a known cheater will result in a ban. This ban may be lifted upon discussion with the directors. Any suspicious activity after that will result in a permanent ban.
```

Thank you for being a part of the Outlaw Island community.   We look forward to shooting you soon.
